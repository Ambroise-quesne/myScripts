Gaussian scripts
================

Script concerning post or pre treatments with Gaussian.

spectre.py
    Plot an UV-visible spectum from the output of a td-DFT calculation. To each
    transition, a gaussian function is added with a given width (in energy) and
    an area equal to the oscillator strength.

xyz.f90
    Extract the last geometry from a gaussian ouput file.
